Capstone Project Proposal
1Ô∏è‚É£ Idea Brief
Project Name: Creatique
Overview:
This project is a MERN stack-based web application that allows users to upload an image and describe a vibe. The app will:
Fetch aesthetic images from Pinterest API based on the vibe.
Automatically remove backgrounds from these images.
Suggest quotes & doodles matching the vibe.
Allow users to drag, resize, and recolor elements on their image.
Provide basic filters (monochrome, sepia, hue shift, etc.).
Let users download & share the final design.
Why This Project?
Combines creativity & technology ‚Äì perfect for social media lovers.
Showcase-worthy: Uses real-world APIs, image processing, and a smooth UI/UX.
Aligns with my interest: I enjoy design, aesthetics, and building cool tools.
